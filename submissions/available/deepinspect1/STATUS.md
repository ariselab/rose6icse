# Apply for the Reusable and Available Badges

We are applying the Reusable and Available badges for the following reason.
- We have made our prototype tool available via Github. We placed it on a publicly accessible repository.
- We carefully documented and well-structured to the extent that reuse and repurposing are facilitated. 
- We provide code to apply our tool on six different datasets and testing 8 different models.
- We made it very easy to reproduce our results in paper by just running three python commands.
